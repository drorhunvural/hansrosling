 Creating a Hans Rosling-inspired visualization project using population data from various countries.


There are four distinct continents represented in this visualization: Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Each circle within the visualization corresponds to an individual country.The size of each circle in the visualization is directly proportional to the population of the corresponding country, meaning that larger circles represent countries with larger populations. As a result, I aimed to create a chart that visualizes the evolution of GDP and life expectancy over the years
